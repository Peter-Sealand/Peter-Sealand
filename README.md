- 👋 Hi, I’m @Peter-Sealand
- 👀 I’m interested in looking for one or two simple projects where I might make minor contributions while learning Git basics.  I already use a private Git repository for my own web site.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CCNA and similar networky stuff.  Been running networks since 1986 (my first server had a massive 80MB of storage).  Wrote a great deal of HPL long ago and far away.  Wallowed in Turbo Pascal for a long time at the same time as C and MS Basic.  Played with Python recently, and a few lines of Perl (the site map in my web site).  Once hacked some Coral66 code.  Enough HTML/CSS to make a site work without looking too awful (you may disagree - check it out at http://www.sealand-systems.co.uk - plain HTML using server-side includes).
- 🌱 Coder - yes.  Graphic designer - NO!!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - who knows - there's a whole world out there ...
- 📫 How to reach me ... if my email isn't already visible in my GitHub profile, then here it is:  psvdavey@sealand-systems.co.uk
